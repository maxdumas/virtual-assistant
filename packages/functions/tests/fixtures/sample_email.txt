brass, and the screams of encouragement from onlookers. Then we'll move =
on to Union Square and do the same. Is this some statement about =
politics or consumerism? Nah, not really, it's about the joy of =
smashing.

understanding of the fundamental principles of SOUND. We will look at =
everything from acoustic theory, dsp, how hardware works, useful =
software, and everything in between. There will be an open ended portion =
at the end of the class for further questions and discussion, and the =
class will mold itself to the needs of the folks taking it.

> This course will take a dive into every aspect of sound. My goal is to =
have you, the eager new(or old) disciple of sound, to walk away feeling =
like you have a basic grasp of how the things we hear come into being. =
The knowledge gained in this course will benefit everyone from artists =
to technicians to venue managers, even your grandma would learn =
something she can use. The class will be in three parts, the first being =
more of a lecture on the principles of sound, the second being a hands =
on to learn how we use and interact with equipment and our surroundings. =
The third is open ended, time to go over anything that confused you or =
to cover things that didn=E2=80=99t come up, whatever is helpful for the =
class. Bring your questions and your listening ears, that=E2=80=99s all =

get through, to a means of self-expression in a part of fashion where =
self-expression is limited. But how might one describe and share how to =
tie a particular knot? And can we use a systematic enough description to =
count how many tieknots could exist, and see whether the ones people use =
are rare or common?
> =20

heckled on NPR and helped get me a green card to the US. In this class I =
will share how counting tieknots can be done, and how the same things =
that help me count tieknots can help you remember how to tie your tie =
and broaden your repertoire.

> World Socialist Cinema: A lecture by Masha Salazkina
> =20
> Light Industry will be hosting a talk by scholar Masha Salazkina, =
related to her recent book World Socialist Cinema. Its focus is the =
Festival of Cinemas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which took place =
in Tashkent, the capital of Soviet Uzbekistan, from the 1960s to the =
1980s. Salazkina uses the history of this festival as an aperture into a =
unique configuration of world cinema, one that emerged through the =
entanglement of internationalist solidarities and trans-racial =
affinities, of personal bonds and institutional connections, of =
multi-faceted artistic expressions and political commitments.

as instrumental and not incidental to telling impactful stories in =
audio. It will explore work that embraces the subjective -- the =
personal, the political, the experimental. And it will examine how =
fiction can be a way to get at the truth.

Uzbekistan, from the 1960s to the 1980s. Salazkina uses the history of =
this festival as an aperture into a unique configuration of world =
cinema, one that emerged through the entanglement of internationalist =
solidarities and trans-racial affinities, of personal bonds and =
institutional connections, of multi-faceted artistic expressions and =
